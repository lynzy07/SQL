In this SQL, I am querying a data set of the highest grossing movies from 2022 and quantifying various sets of data relevant to the data set. 

/* 1. The released movies and gross amounts for 2022? */ 
select release, gross from datasample.highgross22;

select release, open, max(gross) from datasample.highgross22; 

/* 3. What is the average gross for all of the releases in 2022? */ 
select avg(gross) as average_gross from datasample.highgross22; 

/* 4. What distrubtors released the top 200 releases in 2022? */ 
select distributor from datasample.highgross22
group by distributor;  

/* 5. Which releases grossed over 100,000,000 in 2022 and when were they released? */
select release, open, gross from datasample.highgross22
WHERE gross > 100000000
ORDER BY gross desc;

/* 6. What are the top grossing releases opened after 2022-07-01 ? */ 
Select release, gross, open from datasample.highgross22 
where open between '2022-07-01' AND '2022-12-31'
ORDER BY open asc;

/* 7. What is the total gross for the top 200 releases in 2022? */ 
select sum(gross) as total_sum from datasample.highgross22;

/* 8. Which distributor brought in the most amount of money in 2022? */ 
select sum(gross), distributor
from datasample.highgross22
GROUP BY distributor
order by sum(gross) desc;

/* 9. Which distributor brought in the least amount of money in 2022? */ 
select min(gross), distributor
from datasample.highgross22
group by distributor
ORDER BY min(gross)
LIMIT 1; 

/* 10. What are the top 10 grossing movies in 2022 and how much did they earn? */
